\title{P-site offsets data table}
\format{
A data table with 31 rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{length}{Length of the read, in nucleotides (intended as the width of
the reference sequence region covered by the RNA fragment. For further
information about this choice please refer to section \code{Details} of
function \code{\link{bamtolist}})}
\item{total_percentage}{Percentage of reads of the considered length in the
whole dataset}
\item{start_percentage}{Percentage of reads of the considered length
aligning on the start codon (if any)}
\item{around_start}{A logical value whether at least one read of
the considered length aligns on the start codon (T = yes, F = no)}
\item{offset_from_5}{Temporary P-site offset from the 5' end of the read,
in nucleotides (before the correction step)}
\item{offset_from_3}{Temporary P-site offset from the 3' end of the read,
in nucleotides (before the correction step)}
\item{corrected_offset_from_5}{P-site offset from the 5' end of the read, in
nucleotides (after the correction step)}
\item{corrected_offset_from_3}{P-site offset from the 3' end of the read, in
nucleotides (after the correction step)}
\item{sample}{Name of the sample}
}
}
\usage{
psite_offset
}
\description{
An example dataset containing length-specific ribosome P-site offsets as
returned by \code{\link{psite}} applied to \code{\link{reads_list}}.
