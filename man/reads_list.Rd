\title{Reads information data table}
\format{
A list of data tables with 1 object (named \emph{Samp1}) of 100,062
rows and 6 variables:
\describe{
\item{transcript}{Name of the transcript (ENST ID and version, dot
separated)}
\item{end5}{Position of the 5' end of the read with respect to the first
nucleotide of the transcript, in nucleotides}
\item{end3}{Position of the 3' end of the read with respect to the first
nucleotide of the transcript, in nucleotides}
\item{length}{Length of the read, in nucleotides (intended as the width of
the reference sequence region covered by the RNA fragment. For further
information about this choice please refer to section \code{Details} of
function \code{\link{bamtolist}})}
\item{cds_start}{Leftmost position of the annotated CDS with respect to the
first nucleotide of the transcript, in nucleotides}
\item{cds_stop}{Rightmost position of the annotated CDS with respect to the
first nucleotide of the transcript, in nucleotides}
}

\description{
An example dataset containing details on reads mapping on the mouse
transcriptome, generated from BAM or BED files. A subset of the original
dataset is provided, including only reads aligning on the translation
initiation site. Please contact the authors for further information.
