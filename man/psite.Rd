\arguments{
\item{data}{Either list of data tables or GRangesList object from
\code{\link{bamtolist}}, \code{\link{bedtolist}},
\code{\link{duplicates_filter}} or \code{\link{length_filter}}.}

\item{flanking}{Integer value specifying for the selected reads the minimum
number of nucleotides that must flank the reference codon in both
directions. Default is 6.}

\item{start}{Logical value whether to use the translation initiation site as
reference codon. Default is TRUE. If FALSE, the second to last codon is
used instead.}

\item{extremity}{Either "5end", "3end" or "auto". It specifies if the
correction step should be based on 5' extremities ("5end") or 3'
extremities ("3end"). Default is "auto" i.e. the optimal extremity is
automatically selected.}

\item{plot}{Logical value whether to plot the occupancy metaprofiles
displaying the P-site offsets computed in both steps of the algorithm.
Default is FALSE.}

\item{plot_dir}{Character string specifying the directory where read
length-specific occupancy metaprofiles shuold be stored. If the specified
folder doesn't exist, it is automatically created. If NULL (the default),
the metaprofiles are stored in a new subfolder of the working directory,
called \emph{offset_plot}. This parameter is considered only if \code{plot}
is TRUE.}

\item{plot_format}{Either "png" (the default) or "pdf". This parameter
specifies the file format storing the length-specific occupancy
metaprofiles. It is considered only if \code{plot} is TRUE.}

\item{cl}{Integer value in [1,100] specifying a confidence level for
generating occupancy metaprofiles for to a sub-range of read lengths i.e.
for the cl% of read lengths associated to the highest signals. Default is
99. This parameter is considered only if \code{plot} is TRUE.}

\item{txt}{Logical value whether to write in a txt file the extremity used
for the correction step and the best offset for each sample. Similar
information are displayed by default in the console. Default is FALSE.}

\item{txt_file}{Character string specifying the path, name and extension
(e.g. "PATH/NAME.extension") of the plain text file where the extremity
used for the correction step and the best offset for each sample shuold be
written. If the specified folder doesn't exist, it is automatically
created. If NULL (the default), the information are written in
\emph{"best_offset.txt"} and saved in the working directory. This parameter
is considered only if \code{txt} is TRUE.}

A data table.

\description{
This function identifies the exact position of the ribosome P-site within
each read, determined by the localisation of its first nucleotide (see
\code{Details}). It returns a data table containing, for all samples and read
lengths: i) the percentage of reads in the whole dataset, ii) the percentage
of reads aligning on the start codon (if any); iii) the distance of the
P-site from the two extremities of the reads before and after the correction
step; iv) the name of the sample. Optionally, this function plots a
collection of read length-specific occupancy metaprofiles displaying the
P-site offsets computed through the process.
}
\details{
The P-site offset (PO) is defined as the distance between the
  extremities of a read and the first nucleotide of the P-site itself. The
  function processes all samples separately starting from reads mapping on
  the reference codon (either the start codon or the second to last codon,
  see \code{start}) of any annotated coding sequences. Read lengths-specific
  POs are inferred in two steps. First, reads mapping on the reference codon
  are grouped according to their length, each group corresponding to a bin.
  Reads whose extremities are too close to the reference codon are discarded
  (see \code{flanking}). For each bin temporary 5' and 3' POs are defined as
  the distances between the first nucleotide of the reference codon and the
  nucleotide corresponding to the global maximum found in the profiles of the
  5' and the 3' end at the left and at the right of the reference codon,
  respectively. After the identification of the P-site for all reads aligning
  on the reference codon, the POs corresponding to each length are assigned
  to each read of the dataset. Second, the most frequent temporary POs
  associated to the optimal extremity (see \code{extremity}) and the
  predominant bins are exploited as reference values for correcting the
  temporary POs of smaller bins. Briefly, the correction step defines for
  each length bin a new PO based on the local maximum, whose distance from
  the reference codon is the closest to the most frequent temporary POs. For
  further details please refer to the \strong{riboWaltz} article (available
  \href{https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006169}{here}).
